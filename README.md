# Python Examples

This repository contains introductory Python programs using OpenCV.

Much of the code is similar to what is presented on [The OpenCV tutorials page](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html).

The steps below will help you get started.

## Install Python 3.8.6


1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows
2. Click on "Download Python 3.8.6"
3. Click on "save"
4. Run the downloaded executable.
5. Select "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"
6. Click on "Install Now"

## Verify that python works:

1. Open powershell
2. type: ``python``

You should see a prompt: ``>>>``

This is different than the windows prompt. You are typing directly to the Python interpreter.

It will take your input as commands and maybe even do things if you tell it exactly what to do.

## Try some basic python commands

```
a = 5
print(a)
b = 4
print(a + b)
quit()
```

## Install some additional Python packages

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install scikit-image
pip install opencv-python
```

## Install an editor if you don't have one

Download/install [notepad++, an editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads). 
   - Click the link "Notepad++7.8.9:Stand with Hong Kong".
   - Scroll down to the "Downloads 64-bit x64" section and select "Installer"
   - Save the file and then run it.
   - Accept the defaults. You can optionally create a shortcut.
   - **Don't** check the greyed out choice that mentions ``APPDATA``.

## Install git if you haven't already

Download/install [the git version control program](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - Click the link ""64-bit Git for Windows Setup".
   - Save and run the downloaded executable.
   - Accept the defaults.   

## Clone this repository

In a powershell window:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/ftc14382/python_examples.git
```
