# Python Examples

This repository contains introductory Python programs using OpenCV.

Much of the code is similar to what is presented on [The OpenCV tutorials page](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html).

The steps below will help you get started.

## Install Python 3.8.6


1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows
2. Click on "Download Python 3.8.6"
3. Click on "save"
4. Run the downloaded executable.
5. Select "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"
6. Click on "Install Now"

## Verify that python works:

1. Open powershell
2. type: ``python``

You should see a prompt: ``>>>``

This is different than the windows prompt. You are typing directly to the Python interpreter.

It will take your input as commands and maybe even do things if you tell it exactly what to do.

## Try some basic python commands

```
a = 5
print(a)
b = 4
print(a + b)
quit()
```

## Install some additional Python packages

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install scikit-image
pip install opencv-python
```
